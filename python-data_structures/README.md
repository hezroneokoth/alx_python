4. What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
5. How to use lists as stacks and queues

## Requirements

1. Recommended editors: Visual studio code
2. All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
3. All your files should end with a new line
4. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
5. Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
6. The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Tasks

### 0. Can you C me now?

Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.

Prototype: def no_c(my_string):

    The function should return the new string

    You are not allowed to import any module

    You are not allowed to use str.replace()

### 1.  Lists of lists = Matrix

Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.

Prototype: def print_matrix_integer(matrix=[[]]):

    Format: see example
    
    You are not allowed to import any module

    You can assume that the list only contains integers

    You are not allowed to cast integers into strings

    You have to use str.format() to print integers

### 2. More returns

Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

Prototype: def multiple_returns(sentence):

    If the sentence is empty, the first character should be equal to None

    You are not allowed to import any module
