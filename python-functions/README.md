# Python - functions

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

1. What are functions
2. How to define and call a function
3. What are parameters and arguments
4. The role of the return statement in functions
5. Difference between built in functions and user-defined functions
6. How to write functions to solve specific tasks and improve code reusability

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

1. Recommended editors: Visual studio code
2. All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
3. All your files should end with a new line
4. A README.md file at the root of the python-coding repo, containing a description of the repository
5. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
6. The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Tasks

### You don’t need to understand __import__

### 0. a + b

#### Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result

#### Prototype: def add(a, b)

#### Returns the value of a + b

#### You are not allowed to import any module

### 1. a ^ b

#### Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value

#### Prototype: def pow(a, b)

#### Returns the value of a ^ b. You are not allowed to import any module

### 2. Temperature Converter Function

#### Write a Python function called convert_to_celsius that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as input and returns the temperature in Celsius

#### Prototype: def convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit)

#### Returns the temperature in Celsius

#### You are not allowed to import any module. You don’t need to understand __import__

### 3. String Manipulation Function

#### Write a Python function called reverse_string that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string

#### Prototype: def reverse_string(string)

#### Returns the reversed string

### 4. Fibonacci Sequence Function

#### Write a Python function called fibonacci_sequence that takes a number n as input and returns a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers

#### Prototype: def fibonacci_sequence(n)

#### Returns a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers. You are not allowed to import any module

#### Return an empty list if the it is not possible to generate the Fibonacci numbers for n

### 5. Prime Number Function

#### Write a Python function called is_prime that takes a number as input and returns True if the number is prime, and False otherwise

#### Prototype: def is_prime(number)

#### Returns True if the number is prime, and False otherwise

### 6. Password Validation Function

#### Write a Python function called validate_password that takes a password as input and performs the following checks

#### The password should be at least 8 characters long

#### The password should contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit

#### The password should not contain spaces

#### Prototype: def validate_password(password)

#### Returns True if the password passes all the checks, and False otherwise
